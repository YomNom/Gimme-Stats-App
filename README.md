GIMME STATS
This project is a demo app developed to assist athletes in keeping track of their stats on an online platform professionally. This includes information of the scores and moves of each game
and tournament the athlete has played in. It would've allowed recruiters and coaches view the potential of players and see what areas they need to improve in. The tracker would also keep a schedule
of games for both the athlete and staff (coaches, recruiters...etc.). This app demonstrates the foundation for the app and located its data in firebase.
